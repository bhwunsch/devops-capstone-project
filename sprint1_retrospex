What went right?
* read through entire project code so new somewhat how it all fit together
* do see how API routes connect to the core "model" program
* got most of tests/code written in a single day

What went wrong?
* still don't fully grasp how flask is sending/receiving information
* still don't fully grasp how the payloads work when sending requests
* I go too fast, don't double check work before I try running
* I am using code chatbots too much

What would you change for the next sprint?
* need to understand all code better and how it works together
